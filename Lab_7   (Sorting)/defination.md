There are various types of sorting algorithms used to arrange data in a specific order. Here are some commonly used sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort: It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

Selection Sort: It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion. The sorted portion grows with each iteration.

Insertion Sort: It builds the final sorted list by iteratively inserting elements into their correct position within the sorted portion of the list.

Merge Sort: It follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It recursively divides the list into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them to create a sorted list.

Quick Sort: It also follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a pivot element, partitions the list into two sublists (elements smaller than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot), and recursively sorts the sublists.

Heap Sort: It uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It builds a max heap or min heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum or minimum element, swapping it with the last element, and heapifying the remaining heap.

Radix Sort: It sorts elements based on their digit-by-digit value. It starts by sorting the least significant digit and progressively moves to more significant digits.
